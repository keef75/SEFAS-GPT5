# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# To customize agents:
# 1. Modify 'initial_prompt' for any agent to change its behavior
# 2. Adjust 'temperature' (0.1=focused, 0.8=creative) 
# 3. Change 'model' (gpt-4o-mini=fast, gpt-4o=powerful, gpt-5=cutting edge)
# 4. Set 'max_tokens' based on desired response length
# 5. Add custom fields like 'specialization' or 'strategy'

# To modify execution:
# 1. Change 'default_strategy' to control coordination
# 2. Adjust 'topology' connections to change agent collaboration
# 3. Modify 'evolution' parameters to control adaptation
# 4. Set 'priority' levels to influence execution order

# Model recommendations:
# - Strategic agents (orchestrator, strategy_evolver): gpt-4o-mini (fast, consistent)
# - Creative agents (proposer_alpha, innovation_catalyst): gpt-4o (high creativity)
# - Technical agents (technical_architect, domain_expert): gpt-4o (deep reasoning)
# - Validation agents (checkers): gpt-4o (precision and accuracy)
# - Quality agents: gpt-4o-mini (efficiency for routine checks)

# Temperature recommendations:
# - Logic/Consistency: 0.1-0.2 (very focused)
# - Analysis/Technical: 0.2-0.4 (balanced)
# - Research/Strategy: 0.4-0.6 (moderate exploration)
# - Creative/Innovation: 0.6-0.8 (high creativity)
# - Never exceed 0.9 (too random)
